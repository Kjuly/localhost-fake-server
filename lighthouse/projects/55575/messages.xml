    <body>To update data (fixtures) and assets (on s3), we need to run data/asset migration script in an environment with latest production data and assets.

I created an asics2 account on snowwhite.asics.eu, on which asics1 database is running and assets is hosting.

cd app
ASICS=/home/asics/app/current rake old:to_sql

Don't forget to commit updated fixtures back to github.

    <body>Subdomain issue:

* use 'www' (instead of, for example, 'en') if country has only one language, or country default language has a very high weight. So we need a way to adjust language weight in countries.

Running expert:

* a retialer page on asics.eu, for all retailers.

Raphael:

* it would be good to do next product collection update on new system. We'll update collection on June, so we should have a new system with complete frontend, basic backend, and full support to collection update by *May*.

* Easy GA tweaking -  allow admin to express things like: I want to track this page, I want to track that page in this way. Should also allow tracking of AJAX pages/links. I think this basically means customize GA script on each page.

* Emails/Newsletters is an important part.
    - Mailchimp is not convinient enough. HTML Template editor is good but not necessary, asics have people to create the templates.
    - What really need is extra attributes on subscription, or connect subscription with user profile. So we can do things like: send this campaign email to all users who is interested in Kinsei3 and age above 25.
    - mailchimp does provide sending logic based on subscription attributes, we may or may not use it.
    - And email content should be able to be dynamic, because, e.g., contents may vary between countries.
    - tracking emails is important, mailchimp do it well.

* it would be better if we can reduce hosting cost, but not a big deal.

* better way for collaborating? Raphael mentioned campfire.

* Gives us guest account of the internal system. It's better if we can find a way to interface with it directly. e.g. people download product zip file from it and upload the zip to asics CMS directly.

* IBM is building an ERP+ system for asics (global). By the end of the year, we may need to interface with the new system then.

* The ERP system will solve the stocking problem, which is the base of EC site.

* Product image feed for other system to use. This can be part of asics2 and be online earlier than the whole system.

* Our system should be able to store future product images, i.e. images without product data. He metioned Adobe Scene7.

Jack/Stephanie/Koen

* Jack is doing collection update

* Stephanie and Koen will join him to do the same thing

* Jack get collection data from the internal system, then add highlights for each product variation manually.

* He'd prefer use highlight ID instead of names in execl.

* It's good to eliminate the intermedia manual work, like upload all data sheets they have directly.

* To automate the flow we need to understand all the rules Jack used to transform the sheets. We talked some on the meeting, not enough.

* I think the rules should be easy to change in an automated system, DSL is good here.

* Human is still need, because some political problems can not be automated.

* Product collection is very season-focused. What we should show on site is current season products, and allow people to find old season products if they want.

Mutaurwa (OT2)

* Publish at somepoint. e.g. I can create bunch of drafts, set some of them to be published at tomorrow, and system will auto publish them at tomorrow.

* too much info on products page (should focus on current collection/season?), not enough info on product page (should connect to other elements on site).

* My observation is Mutaurwa use 'Publish Immediately' almost all the time, which indicates for certain users, 'Publish Immeidately' is the common case, while 'Publish as Draft' is special case. The publish system may be much more simpler if we design the system for this kind of using.

* At least, use checkbox for 'Publish Immediately' is inconvinient to Mutaurwa: he need 2 clicks to save data. A 'Publish Immediately' button will be better.</body>

Goal of this meeting: One single place for product information/photography for internal use and specifically to display product images on retail cash register displays.

Current situation:  
there is the digital marketing media library ASICS Bank managed 1.5 TB by Comrad and the PIM system managed by IT.
The 'ASICS cms&quot; (ruby and mysql system) is working with the ASICS Bank. ASICS cms get export from Comrad every season.

The above Comrad system willed be killed in the future and feature development has been cancelled. Comrad wants to upgrade to a system that we don't want to go with.

Future solution: 
Akamai or AWS central server Perhaps adobe scene 7 (ACJ started a trial with this) server to let them handle crop/resize capabilities. Can add all this effects in a url using a single media server.

Pim could get item/color or complete list from cms that will generate an .xml file with in it all data and url to images product.(front, back, side etc)
for example: http://en.ec2.asics.eu/feed/imagescompletecatalog.xml
with in it:
&lt;products ID=&quot;TN800&quot;&gt;
&lt;coloring color ID =&quot;0900&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src =&quot;http:///&quot;
...
&lt;/product&gt;
In future probably 360 photography. 20 pics per shoe.

Current CMS has only upcoming season uploaded. PIM needs to upload photo samples for season further ahead of time for other departments. Need to be earlier because now we only look to the coming season. not three or 4 ahead.

Timeline for this project? Depends, unclear

Action points;
The plant will work with IT to provide above image feed.


@@@

ASICS IT dept want to
have a center location to store product images, And Raphael recommend
us to do so,
And I think it's a good thing, maybe we can continue to do the Future
product media library, Which Raphael is thinking about using Adoble
Scene 7.</body>

        <body>#Task: Mimic www.asics.co.uk/running/knowledge/#
&lt;br/&gt;
**Q:**

* **where're the images(uri)?**&lt;br/&gt;
The s3 resource(images...) migrating(from local) feature in oni will be integrated into qor first, then with this feature, images can be uploaded to a new bucket in s3. 
* **what's the query condition for index page(/running/knowledge/)?**&lt;br/&gt;
see **On project specifications**
* **what're the query conditions for sub-index(/running/knowledge/preparation/,...) pages?**&lt;br/&gt;
see **On project specifications**
* **where's the original specification for the whole site hierarchy, details for each column/page clusters respectively? (from the client probably.)** actually this one includes the 2 above.&lt;br/&gt;
see **On project specifications**
* **what're other coding rules excluding the previous routes.rb coding rule issued by Mr. Sun?**

&lt;br/&gt;
**Progress:**

* add Knowledge controller. **&lt;----done**
* add routes to /running/knowledge/, /running/knowledge/preparation/, /running/knowledge/xxxx/. **&lt;----done**&lt;br/&gt;
As http requests will be routed in rails' default restful style, and qor handles all the CUD parts of CRUD, available methods for KnowledgeController are left to be: #index and #show.
* add index.html.erb for /running/knowledge/ **&lt;----done, sub_navigation part pending, due 20101111180000**
* add sub_index.html.erb for /running/knowledge/sub_index/ **&lt;----done, sub_navigation part pending, due 20101111180000**
* add article.html.erb for /running/knowledge/articlexxxx_xx/ **&lt;---- on it now, due 20101111180000**
* integrate s3 resource migrating feature into qor.

use no merb, no datamapper. Guess it's because qor is with no merb.
From Mr. Lee, Rails has a cool query interface in its edge version(&gt;=3.0.0). It simplified the process of rewriting the old datamapper queries, cool.

        <body>#Task: Integrate s3 resource migrating feature into qor &lt;----Done&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
**Features:**

* update paperclip image resource for model object with existing column value(a relative path of an image).

&lt;br/&gt;
**S3 bucket issue:**&lt;br/&gt;
As stated in this official doc:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/index.html?VirtualHosting.html
An EU bucket responds a 301 status code when it's requested with this host name: 
    s3.amazonaws.com 
and the correct host name for an EU bucket is:
    s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
But, the gem, aws-s3, used by paperclip, requests any bucket with a fixed host: s3.amazonaws.com.
**Solution:**&lt;br/&gt;
In config/environment.rb, this line solves the trouble:
AWS::S3::DEFAULT_HOST.replace &quot;s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com&quot;


&lt;br/&gt;
**Notes:**&lt;br/&gt;
It took about a day(6h) to update images for all knowledge objects(total:807).</body>

        <body>**On Project: Rebuild of Asics on Qor**&lt;br/&gt;
To apply the same frontend and a qor integration, we need a progress.
(Always we need a framework and a list, when we have a framework, we could construct workloads basing on the list, then we can get our hands wet to tackle them one by one by someone or simultaneously by different staff.)
&lt;br/&gt;The **framework**(besides rails hierarchy) could be:

* Application settings.
* Resource configurations.(S3...)
* Common error handling. including 404 pages handling...
* Session management including multination access, user sessions...
* Qor integration.
* Layouts.
* ...

and the **list** could be **one of**(the most efficient arrangement):

* a list of asics functions
* a list of asics routes
* Decided: the list of old asics views.&lt;br/&gt;
Reason: the focuses of the project are: 
to integrate qor, 
to clone/modify all the old views adapting them to activerecord based models.
so the workloads map exactly to the views including the old ones and that qor brings in.</body>

The &lt;strong&gt;framework&lt;/strong&gt;(besides rails hierarchy) could
be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource configurations.(S3...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common error handling. including 404 pages handling...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session management including multination access, user
sessions...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qor integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the &lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; could be &lt;strong&gt;one
of&lt;/strong&gt;(the most efficient arrangement):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a list of asics functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a list of asics routes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decided: the list of old asics views.&lt;br&gt;
Reason: the focuses of the project are:&lt;br&gt;
to integrate qor,&lt;br&gt;
to clone/modify all the old views adapting them to activerecord
based models.&lt;br&gt;
so the workloads map exactly to the views including the old ones
and that qor brings in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</body-html>

        <body>Take control on:
Every single view.
Every single line.

#Task:#
Move control of:
TopMenu Items
Navigation Items
to Qor models.

Configed resource_engine.rb to present the 2 item into the drop down menu.
Investigated a lot into Qor's resource_engine and localization feature as the 2 items need to be localized.

My question is how to let the system write default language_id(the current) to the newly created records? I think it has something to do with localization, I'm investigating it...(YES!)
Now I have a Qor::Dolilo::Forbidden, do I need some configuration in the rulefile.rb?
grant added into rulefile.rb, and it starts to work.

I think now totally understand some ideas of Qor.
e.g. the a little bit weird hierarchical implementation of configurations.
the theme/template thing for the CMS frontend.
...
it's taken some time, but my knowledge about ruby, rails, even vim has been extended quite a bit. feels good.</body>

        <body>In yesterday's qor meeting, we had sorta of a code review, some opinions from others are:

* verbose local variable names
* do end instead of {}
* no personal signature in comments

&lt;br/&gt;
My philosophy is: as little as possible - ALAP, which means:

* as few local variable as possible
* local variable name as short as possible (global var names as detail as possible, you have to.)
* keystrokes as few as possible
* find the person who's responsible for the piece of code as fast as possible
* use arrays instead of hashes - indices are perfect for unique keys
* use |x| for any enumerable - so you won't think of what's the object this time? it's always x,y,z,b,d,e,...(a for array objects, c for counter, h for hash, k for key, v for value)
* ...

and some others:

* data processing procedural as clear as possible - indicate steps with indents
