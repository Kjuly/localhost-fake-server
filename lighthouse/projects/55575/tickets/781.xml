  <original-body>This is my problem:

I wanted to publish all stores, but not publish all resources. When I clicked on the Stores link in the Publish menu, I could Publish 100 stores at a time, but I wasn't sure if I clicked on &quot;Select all&quot; next to the Publish button if it would publish all resources (Tech Tour, Setting, and so on) or just all the Stores (what I wanted). I wasn't sure, so what I did is publish 100 stores at a time, 11 times.

I think we need an easy way to Publish all the resources that you are looking at. I recommend:

* Changing the text &quot;Select all&quot; =&gt; &quot;Select all {resource type}&quot; so... something like &quot;Select all Stores&quot;, and only publish the stores.

One more small point on this... the pagination layout is a little strange. Please fix it too :-)</original-body>

It would publish all resources, FYI you could click the next page to select the next 100 stores, and do it 11 times to publish all stores, I know it is also a bad idea ;) .... 

Maybe provide an checkbox beside the Store link in the Publish menu, I think it would make publish serveal models easier? ...</body>

* Changing the text &quot;Select all&quot; =&gt; &quot;Select all {resource type}&quot; so... something like &quot;Select all Stores&quot;, and only publish the stores.

Or your option... whichever you think has the best usability.</body>
