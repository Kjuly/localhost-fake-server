  <original-body>I chatted with Raph and he would like to add the following:

* Users (total, displayed monthly... for example, there were 10000 users in january, 11000 users in february...)
* MailChimp signups (total, displayed monthly)
* What products are most viewed (use same as we made for OT?)
* What categories (sports) are most viewed
* Inside running, what types of pages are most viewed (products nav, product pages, knowledge, events, ambassadors).


He also said: Bazaarvoice stats would be good too. Not sure if BV has an API we can use to get these or if we can generate some on our onw... (lower priority)

All of this is lower priority than getting the store locator to work properly.</original-body>
