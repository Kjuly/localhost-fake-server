  <original-body>Running Clinics
1. Running clinics are not all migrated
2. Print doesn't work. Should have map. Should look good. See current site.
3. Link in mail about Running Clinic is pointing to dev site (probably not a
bug?)
4. Running clinics admin: getting errors about break times, but there are no
breaks for running clinics
5. Running clinics blue box layout is bad. Should match current site
EXACTLY.
6. Can not classify an article as a Running Clinics Articles in admin and the
front end is choosing the wrong articles
7. Running Clinic address is missing a &#8220;, &#8220; between address elements.
8. Running Clinic Search: Search results page typography is very bad.
&#65532;
&#65532;9. Would like inline edit for Running Clinic top page (introductory text, pro team text and members (these people have changed) (low priority)</original-body>
